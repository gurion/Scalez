## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 21

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
The idea seems intersting. Would love to see the final product.

### Features
Looks good.

### UI sketches

UI doesn't look very intuitive and its so small and sketchy that its hard to understand what is going on (lots of wiggle lines and dots instead of actual content).  Please either draw a LOT bigger or use a tool, and also improve the way the flow is shown to make it more understandable.

(-5 points)

### Use Cases

Looks good.

### Architecture

Looks good.

### General Remarks

**Grade: 95/100**
