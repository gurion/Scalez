---------------------------------------------
**Group 21**

**Evaluators: [M, S](mailto:mshu1@jhu.edu) and [M, W](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu@)**

### Attendance and contribution
[5 points] (Anyone missing without an advanced excuse?  Everyone doing at least some talking?)
5/5 Everyone talked and attended to the lecture.

### Overview of project
[10 points] (Clearly explained and understandable?  Got us at least a little excited about the app?)
10/10 The app is very interesting and understandable.

### Demo
[25 points] (Clear?  No glitches?  Live or recorded? Good progress shown?)
22/25
Demo is not live, but it is understandable why this is the case.
But the demo could have shown a live demo of the APP processing a pre-recorded audio. 

### Architecture
[5 points] (Explained clearly if its non-standard?)
5/5 

### Code review / UML diagram
[5 points] (Some interesting code or algorithm explained well?)
5/5 
Mapping to standard template using Fourier Transform doesn’t seem to take into account “style” factors like you mentioned in the slides; some improvements can be made to the algorithm.

### Presentation organization
[10 points] (Presentation started promptly? Flow was smooth from speaker to speaker?  No need to huddle mid-presentation to decide what to do next?)
10/10

### Talking
[15 points] (Easy to understand speech and points being made?)
15/15

### Quality of slides
[15 points] (Information easily readable and well presented?)
11/15
UI implementations are hand-drawn and not very organized.

### Project comments emerging during the talk
[10 points] (Technical comments about the project itself not fitting into any of the above can go here)
10/10

**Grade:  93/100**
