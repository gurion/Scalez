# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 21

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[30 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including  integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)

Looks good.

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file and package structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  DRY not happening?)

Code quality looks good but there are a lot of python files in the root directory not part of any folder. This is a bad practice.

(-5 points)

### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)

Looks good.

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?

Looks good.

#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)

Looks good.

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]

Looks good.

### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed and working on Heroku or AWS or other?)

Looks good.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)

Looks good.

### Iteration submission and reporting

Looks good

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[5 points]

Looks good

### Other Remarks


**Grade: 95/100**
