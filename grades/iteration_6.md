# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 21 Scalez (Manan)

### Presentation Style [15 points]
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Excellent. Bringing the instruments was a nice touch.

### App demo [35 points]
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed? Was it a live demo?)

Yes, great job of showing everything live.

### UI quality based on the demo [10 points]
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

The UI was basic, but functional. It would have been better to break apart the score to give more insight on the performance. For example, timing vs. pitch.

Also, it would have been nice to be able to hear the audition you requested from someone else, and to see (a simplified version of) the histogram and how it compared to a perfect scale.

-1

### Testing and Coverage [5 points]
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

Looks good.

### Build/Package/Deploy and git usage [10 points]
(Same as previous iterations)

Looks good.

### Non-CRUD feature [10 points]
(Did this make it across the finish line as a usable feature in the final app?)

The non-CRUD feature was analyzing the audio and scoring. They used libraries to do the heavy lifting, but the final product was *very* polished.

### Iteration progress reporting [5 points]
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

Looks good.

### Evaluation of project difficulty [10 points]
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

The project difficulty was appropriate for the number of people in the group.

### Overall Remarks

Great idea for an app!

**Grade: 99/100**
